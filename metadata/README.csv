KL-1 inversion code all.Rmd,NA,This script loads all the data and identifies the inversions from the PCA.
KL-2 inversion code LGX.Rmd,NA,"Identify which inversion PCA cluster each individual belongs to (e.g. which arrangement it has), indentify outliers on LGX between Iceland and Maine within each arrangement. This is written as a loop but with seeds set to ensure the correct clustering is returned each time that it is run."
