These files are genotype matrices for the inversions on each linkage group
      Each matrix has individuals in rows and SNPs in columns
      Each cell has the number of copies of the reference allele
      The row names are the chromosome_position and correspond to the "muts" file
      The column names are the individual sample ID and correspond to the "Samples" file
